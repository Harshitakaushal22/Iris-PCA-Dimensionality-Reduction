# 🌸 Iris PCA - Dimensionality Reduction

This project demonstrates how to reduce the dimensions of the famous Iris dataset using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and visualize it in 2D.

## 📌 Objective
- Reduce the 4D Iris dataset into 2 dimensions.
- Visualize clusters by species using a scatter plot.

## 🧪 Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Results
- The dataset was reduced from 4 features to 2 principal components.
- The 2D scatter plot clearly shows clustering between different species.

## 📁 File
- `Iris.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with PCA steps and visualizations.
